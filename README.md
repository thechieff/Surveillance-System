# Surveillance-System
We can connect all CCTV cameras to this system to track someone's live location in a premise using facial recognition. It can also be used to maintain records of people entering a premise using their face instead of bio-metrics/cards/manual Entry.
This system when used with national criminal database can track criminals and prevent mishaps.
